Scenario: You’re building a library system with two types of users: Librarians and
Members. Librarians manage books, checkouts, and returns, while members can view
books and check them out but are limited to 5 at a time. Both members and librarians
can see if a book is overdue, and books should be returned within 21 days of checkout.
Books are linked to authors and should be filterable by author.
